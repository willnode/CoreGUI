------------------------ CoreGUI ------------------------

Thank you for choosing CoreGUI!

CoreGUI is an abstraction from Immediate Mode GUI (IMGUI)
to make you, as a programmer, get up and running for more
complex UI elegantly in just a little time.

For a quick glance, we have set-up some example scripts
and playable scenes inside folder "Sample". Go check it
out!

Remember that .NET 4.x must be enabled in Player Settings
(this is not a requirement, you can keep using Legacy .NET
3.5 by deleting whole Sample folder if you want to).

Besides examples, check out our documentation (links below)
for a quick tutorial and in-depth explanation of what CoreGUI
features can be useful to you.
